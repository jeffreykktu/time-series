# Time Series Forecasting for Energy Consumption in the US
### Objective
- Build an ML model to train on time-series data.
- Perform EDA, Feature Engineering, and Model Building.
- Forecast 1 year in the future of the data.
- Save the model for future tuning.

### Technique
- Lag Features Engineering.
- Cross Validation Model Training on Time-Series Data.

### Data
- Over 10 years of hourly energy consumption data from PJM in Megawatts
- PJM Interconnection LLC (PJM) is a regional transmission organization (RTO) in the United States. It is part of the Eastern Interconnection grid operating an electric transmission system serving all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia.
- The hourly power consumption data comes from PJM's website and are in megawatts (MW).
- The regions have changed over the years so data may only appear for certain dates per region.
